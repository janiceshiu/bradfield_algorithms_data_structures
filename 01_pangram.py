  A pangram is a phrase which contains every letter at least once, such as “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”.

  Write a function which determines if a given string is a pangram.

  This should be an easy problem, so it’s a good excuse to practice Polya’s method. So, please find at least three different strategies for solving this problem, proceeding through Polya’s method each time. In each case, make a note of how you came to that.
